This RRM Prototype (Version November 2015) simply runs by double-clicking RRM.exe in the directory
"RRM Prototype v-0.1". We have tested this version on Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Input images are located in the folder "Images". You can drag and drop them into the left panel 
of the softare to start sketching. All operations work with a mouse. Some key controls are

- Mouse-wheel: Zoom in/out
- Generate a new bounding box: Sketching->Sketch at New Boundary (or Ctrl+B). Note you always need  
  a bounding box to start sketching
- Basic sketching mode: Hit any key
- Remove below intersection: Click central mouse button
- Remove above intersection: Click right mouse button
- Update 3D model: Q (note that mouse pointer needs to be in the drawing window)
- Save PNG image of cross-secion: P (note that mouse pointer needs to be in the drawing window). 
  The image will be saved in the same directory as RRM.exe and always has the name CrossSection.png
- Toggle between drawn cross-section and image: F1 and F2 (note that mouse pointer needs to 
  be in the drawing window)

Steps to perform a flow calculation
- Windows->Window Flow Computation
- Open User Input (Note: User input is always the User-Input-*.txt file, surface mesh is always 
  the Geometry-*.poly file; select a *.txt and *.poly file with the same name from director 
  "Input Meshes"; these are simple tests as the automated meshing of the RRM models will be part
  of the next release, alleviating this read-in step)
- Generate a mesh: Click "Volumetric Meshing"
- Compute pressure: Click "Compute PRessure"
- Compute Velocity: Click "Compute Velocity"
- Compute TOF: Clieck "Compute TOF"
- Visualise the property of choice from the drop-down menu
- Change color Map, Visualise Grid, Output calcuation to VTK: Ctrl + right mouse button and 
  select relevant option
